# The story
It was a normal day in the office when suddenly, the bosses decided to play a game, and dropped this random test on us - the employees. In an email with the subject `Senior Engineer Assessment`, sent at 4pm Friday, the task is to review the file and to send it over before midnight. I hope what I'm doing doesn't cross any line. Please tell me if it does. As of now I'll post this because I love what I wrote.

## What do I need?
No setup at all. It's just a txt file. You can read it here.

## What to do now?
Read `before.txt`  
Read `after.txt`
