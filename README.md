# The story
It was a normal day in the office then suddenly, the bosses decided to play a game, and dropped this random test on us the employees. In an email with the subject `Senior Engineer Assessment`, sent at 4pm Friday, with this as just the side-task in an already busy week, to review the file and to send it over before midnight. 

## 4pm
[`task.txt`](task.txt)  

## 12am
[`reviewed.txt`](reviewed.txt)

## heads high
Mavericks dont skip the task
