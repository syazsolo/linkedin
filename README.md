It was a normal day in the office when suddenly, the bosses decided to play a game, and dropped this random test on us the employees. In an email with the subject `Senior Engineer Assessment`, sent at 4pm Friday, with this as just the side-task in an already busy week, to review the file and to send it over before midnight.

here is the [task.txt](before.txt)  

# 12am
